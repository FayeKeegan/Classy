      That's fine.. Just a little weird.
      <br>
      Why go through the trouble of creating a classroom if you aren't even teaching a class in there..
      <br>

      Would you like to create a new section that you plan on teaching in <%= classroom.escape("name") %>?

      Nope. I don't want to create a new section. Take me back to the index.
    </a>
    <a href="#/section/new" class="btn btn-info yes-create-section">
      Yes, please! Take me there!
